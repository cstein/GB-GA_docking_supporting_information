# GB-GA_docking_supporting_information
Supporting Information for our recent work in [Using a genetic algorithm to find molecules with good docking scores](dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.13525589).

In this repository you will find data files in the `data` folder as well as python scripts to generate all figures and tables in the manuscript.
All scripts can be run by simply writing
```python
python figure_1.py
```
in a command line to generate Figure 1 for example.
